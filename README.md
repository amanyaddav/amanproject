Title of the Project
Interactive Web Form using JsonPowerDB (JPDB)

Description
This project aims to create an interactive web form that uses JsonPowerDB (JPDB) for database management. The form will allow users to manage data for specific entities (e.g., Student Enrollment, Project Management, or Shipment Management). The web form interacts with a database, where data can be created, updated, and saved based on user input.

The form features three main control buttons: Save, Update, and Reset. When the form is loaded, the user can either save new data (if the primary key does not exist) or update existing data (if the primary key exists in the database). Data validity checks are applied to ensure no fields are left empty before saving or updating the data.

Benefits of using JsonPowerDB
Real-Time Data Operations: JsonPowerDB is a high-performance, real-time database with a fast querying mechanism that supports real-time data management without the need for complex configurations.

Lightweight and Fast: JPDB is designed to be lightweight, making it perfect for web and mobile applications that require fast data operations without heavy resource usage.

Supports Multiple Formats: JPDB supports various data formats such as JSON, which makes it highly flexible and easy to work with for modern web applications.

RESTful API: JPDB offers a RESTful API for seamless integration with web forms and applications, allowing easy data exchange between front-end applications and the database.

Scalable: JsonPowerDB is designed to scale effortlessly, making it ideal for both small projects and large-scale applications.

No Setup Required: The database is accessible through simple API calls, so there’s no need for complex database setup, making it suitable for rapid development and prototyping.

Scope of Functionalities
Data Entry Form: A simple form that allows users to enter and save data.

CRUD Operations: Allows users to Create new records, Read existing records, Update them, and Delete if necessary.

Primary Key Validation: Ensures that primary keys are not duplicated, and if present, enables data retrieval and updates.

User Validation: Ensures that all required fields are filled in before submission.

Examples of Use
Student Enrollment Form:

Input fields: Roll-No, Full-Name, Class, Birth-Date, Address, Enrollment-Date.

Action: When a student’s Roll-No is entered, the form checks if the student exists. If not, it allows the user to save the data. If it exists, it allows the user to update the data.

Project Management Form:

Input fields: Project-ID, Project-Name, Assigned-To, Assignment-Date, Deadline.

Action: Allows project managers to track project details, and if the Project-ID exists, updates the existing project’s information.

Shipment Management Form:

Input fields: Shipment No., Description, Source, Destination, Shipping Date, Expected Delivery Date.

Action: Shipment details can be added, updated, or viewed based on Shipment No.

Project Status
Current Status: The project is complete with full functionality, including form creation, database interaction, and validation.

Future Work:

Expand the form to support additional fields and validations.

Implement better error handling and data protection (e.g., SQL injection prevention).

Add advanced features such as sorting and filtering the data in the database.

Other Information
Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React.js)

Backend: JsonPowerDB (JPDB)

API: REST API calls for database interaction

Validation: JavaScript validation for form fields.

Challenges Faced:

Ensuring smooth API integration with JsonPowerDB.

Handling errors gracefully during data fetching and saving operations.

Implementing validation to avoid empty form submissions.
